## TODO

### Short term
(This includes items more pertaining to other backends)

* Distinct favicon for playout control
* Documentation (including here)
* Stream events API for ATEM status
* POST API for ATEM:
  * AUX control
* Refactor still image generation
  * Render to PNGs in this code base using canvas tag
  * Make atem-control accept PNGs and convert to RGBA
* Stream events for playout status

### Longer term

* Allow users to be delegated control of playout during live transmissions
